¿Cómo perdió el brazo Herman, el propietario del Anticuario Militar de Springfield?
He told Bart that the other arm was lost by sticking it out of the window of a moving bus 
and it was torn off by a truck in the other direction. It was also implied it was him, as 
Ms. Krabappel said not to do it because a kid once lost an arm that way, while on a bus.

Tristemente...

Lo saco por la ventanilla del bus
